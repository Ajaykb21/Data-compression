A computer network is the interconnection of computing devices in order to share data and is built with a combination of computer hardware and software WikiAnswers- Unknown author. Computer networks are used to connect multiple computers to an internet connection, or to printers, scanners, etc in the same area that the network covers. There are many types of networks that are classified using several different characteristics of each network. This report will discuss some of the characteristics that are used to classify the network, such as the connection method of the computer network, types of networks as determined by their size, scope, and purpose, as well as some of the basic hardware that is used to create a computer network.There are two basic connection methods: wired connection and wireless connection. Each type of wired connection is classified by which type of wiring it uses to create the network. Generally wireless connections are classified by the type of network they create (we will be discussing these later), since they don't use any wiring and therefore couldn't be classified by the different types of wiring.
